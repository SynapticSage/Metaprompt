"""
Batch Prompting: This technique involves generating multiple outputs from
different, same or slightly varied prompts, often repeated over a large number
of inputs (e.g., 100 or more). 

For same inputs, the goal is to explore the range of possible responses the AI
can generate. By collecting a broad set of responses, patterns can be analyzed,
or the most relevant or creative outputs can be selected. This technique is
particularly useful for tasks like brainstorming, where diversity of ideas is
valued, or for fine-tuning the AI by identifying and addressing common errors
or biases across a large sample size.
